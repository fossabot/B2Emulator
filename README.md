An emulator for the Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage service. The goal of the project is to mimic the B2 API to provide a tool that can be used to test applications built to use B2.

**Note:** This project is currently in a pre-alpha state. There is little coverage of the B2 API and no test coverage.

## Current **partially** implemented endpoints

* b2_upload_file ("fileInfo" ignored, error codes don't match B2 API)
